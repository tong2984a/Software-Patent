# Drafting by keeping multiple patent offices in mind 

- Your specification should provide support readily for claim drafting to belong in any one of the four 方法/步骤, namely, 1、涉及自动化技术处理过程, 2、涉及计算机内部运行性能改进, 3、涉及测量或测试计算机程序过程, 4、用于外部数据处理的软件.

- When we draft a patent, a best practice is writing towards a technical effect standard while keeping multiple Patent Offices in mind, and therefore one patent application for many different audiences. We try to draft a patent in such a way that would satisfy a first choice of patent office. When we draft additional applications for filing to other patent offices in the future, the whole process will have more to do with how the patent is drafted and how we capture the innovation, and not really a huge difference about what the underlying innovation is or how it’s implemented.

- When drafting a patent that would satisfy USPTO, we try to keep patentability in mind. By way of illustration, one may decide to implement aspects of a video compression algorithm in hardware because it is faster, or you might want the flexibility of doing it in aspects of software. An inventor may decide to embody an innovation in a hardware product or a software product as a design choice. 

- To determine patentability, we look at claims as a whole, considering their elements both individually, and as an ordered combination. This may sound like a lot of legal mumbo jumbo, so a quick example here may be more helpful. As far as USPTO patent eligibility is concerned, there have been many examples and guidance provided for the record, and I will refer to this one document dated back to July 2015. A copy of the document is available here at https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ieg-july-2015-app1.pdf

- I will now turn to example #23 from p7 to p12 of the above document for our illustration purpose. In this example, the cited invention is a Graphical User Interface For Relocating Obscured Textual Information. Note how only claims 1, 4 are deemed patent eligible even though there are other claims included in the same invention.  

- I hope this makes it more clear that drafting towards USPTO standard could be quite different than drafting towards for example CNIPA standard. While USPTO eligibility has to do with abstract idea and judicial exception, CNIPA eligibility has to do with 计算机, 程序, 软件, and so there is really no straightforward crosswalks between the two. When time comes to filing to CNIPA in the future, I will assist you in drafting claims to belong in one or more of the 4 方法/步骤.
